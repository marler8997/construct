/*
This file shows how the core constructs could be defined.
However, they cannot be defined here because they are needed to define constructs.
Without these constructs you can't define any constructs so it is just for demonstration purposes.

defcon defcon (name utf8) (evalTo type);
defcon deftype ...;
defcon construct (name utf8) evalTo=construct;
defcon struct (name symbol, /list ...?);
